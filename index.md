### Project 1: [Housing Price Predidctor](https://duckduckgo.com)

- Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
- typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
- standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
- when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
- scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
- It has survived not only five centuries, 
- but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
- remaining essentially unchanged. 

### Project 2: [Something More](https://duckduckgo.com)
- It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of 
- Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
- and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
- PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
